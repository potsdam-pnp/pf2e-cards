You create an illusion that causes you to appear as another creature of the same body shape,
and with roughly similar height (within 6 inches) and weight (within 50 pounds), as yourself.

The disguise is typically good enough to hide your identity, but not to impersonate a specific individual.
The spell doesn't change your voice, scent, or mannerisms.

You can change the appearance of your clothing and worn items, such as making your armor look like a dress.
Held items are unaffected, and any worn item you remove returns to its true appearance.

Casting illusory disguise counts as setting up a disguise for the Impersonate use of Deception;
it ignores any circumstance penalties you might take for disguising yourself as a dissimilar creature,
it gives you a +4 status bonus to Deception checks to prevent others from seeing through your disguise,
and you add your level even if you're untrained.
You can Dismiss this spell.
